<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Stevensonians owe a debt of
gratitude to the Bibliophile Society of Boston for having
discovered the following poems and given them light in a
privately printed edition, thus making them known, in fact, to
the world at large.&nbsp; Otherwise they would have remained
scattered and hidden indefinitely in the hands of various
collectors.&nbsp; They will be found extraordinarily interesting
in their self-revelation, and some, indeed, are so intimate and
personal that one understands why Stevenson withheld them from
all eyes save his own.&nbsp; The love-poems in particular, though
they are of very unequal merit, possess in common a really
affecting sincerity.&nbsp; That Stevenson should have preserved
these poems through all the vicissitudes of his wandering life
shows how dearly he must have valued them; and shows, too, I
think, beyond any contradiction, that he meant they should be
ultimately published.</p>

1</span>PRAYER</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">ask</span> good things
that I detest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With speeches fair;<br />
Heed not, I pray Thee, Lord, my breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But hear my prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">I say ill things I would not say&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Things unaware:<br />
Regard my breast, Lord, in Thy day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not my prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">My heart is evil in Thy sight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My good thoughts flee:<br />
O Lord, I cannot wish aright&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish Thou for me.</p>
<p class="poetry">O bend my words and acts to Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; However ill,<br />
That I, whate&rsquo;er I say or be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May serve Thee still.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>O let my thoughts abide in Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest I should fall:<br />
Show me Thyself in all I see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou Lord of all.</p>
<h2>LO! IN THINE HONEST EYES I READ</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Lo</span>! in thine honest
eyes I read<br />
The auspicious beacon that shall lead,<br />
After long sailing in deep seas,<br />
To quiet havens in June ease.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy voice sings like an inland bird<br />
First by the seaworn sailor heard;<br />
And like road sheltered from life&rsquo;s sea<br />
Thine honest heart is unto me.</p>
<h2>THOUGH DEEP INDIFFERENCE SHOULD DROWSE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Though</span> deep
indifference should drowse<br />
The sluggish life beneath my brows,<br />
And all the external things I see<br />
Grow snow-showers in the street to me,<br />
Yet inmost in my stormy sense<br />
Thy looks shall be an influence.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Though other loves may come and go<br />
And long years sever us below,<br />
Shall the thin ice that grows above<br />
Freeze the deep centre-well of love?<br />
No, still below light amours, thou<br />
Shalt rule me as thou rul&rsquo;st me now.</p>
<p class="poetry">Year following year shall only set<br />
Fresh gems upon thy coronet;<br />
And Time, grown lover, shall delight<br />
To beautify thee in my sight;<br />
And thou shalt ever rule in me<br />
Crowned with the light of memory.</p>
<h2>MY HEART, WHEN FIRST THE BLACK-BIRD SINGS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> heart, when first
the blackbird sings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart drinks in the song:<br />
Cool pleasure fills my bosom through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spreads each nerve along.</p>
<p class="poetry">My bosom eddies quietly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is stirred and cool<br />
As when a wind-moved briar sweeps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stone into a pool</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; My pulses thicken fast,<br />
As when the maddened lake grows black<br />

<h2>I DREAMED OF FOREST ALLEYS FAIR</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">dreamed</span> of forest
alleys fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fields of gray-flowered grass,<br />
Where by the yellow summer moon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Jenny seemed to pass.</p>
<p class="poetry">I dreamed the yellow summer moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind a cedar wood,<br />
Lay white on fields of rippling grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where I and Jenny stood.</p>
<p class="poetry">I dreamed&mdash;but fallen through my dream,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a rainy land I lie<br />
Where wan wet morning crowns the hills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of grim reality.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">I am as one that keeps awake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All night in the month of June,<br />
That lies awake in bed to watch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees and great white moon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>For memories of love are more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the white moon there above,<br />
And dearer than quiet moonshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the thoughts of her I love.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Last night I lingered long without<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My last of loves to see.<br />
Alas! the moon-white window-panes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stared blindly back on me.</p>
<p class="poetry">To-day I hold her very hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her very waist embrace&mdash;<br />
Like clouds across a pool, I read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts upon her face.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet, as now, through her clear eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I seek the inner shrine&mdash;<br />
I stoop to read her virgin heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In doubt if it be mine&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">O looking long and fondly thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What vision should I see?<br />
No vision, but my own white face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That grins and mimics me.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>IV.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Once more upon the same old seat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same sunshiny weather,<br />
The elm-trees&rsquo; shadows at their feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And foliage move together.</p>
<p class="poetry">The shadows shift upon the grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dial point creeps on;<br />
The clear sun shines, the loiterers pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As then they passed and shone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now deep sleep is on my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep sleep and perfect rest.<br />
Hope&rsquo;s flutterings now disturb no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The quiet of my breast.</p>
<h2>ST. MARTIN&rsquo;S SUMMER</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> swallows turning
backward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When half-way o&rsquo;er the sea,<br />
At one word&rsquo;s trumpet summons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They came again to me&mdash;<br />
The hopes I had forgotten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came back again to me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>I know not which to credit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O lady of my heart!<br />
Your eyes that bade me linger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your words that bade us part&mdash;<br />
I know not which to credit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My reason or my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">But be my hopes rewarded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or be they but in vain,<br />
I have dreamed a golden vision,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gathered in the grain&mdash;<br />
I have dreamed a golden vision,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not lived in vain.</p>
<h2>DEDICATION</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> first gift and my
last, to you<br />
I dedicate this fascicle of songs&mdash;<br />
The only wealth I have:<br />
Just as they are, to you.</p>
<p class="poetry">I speak the truth in soberness, and say<br />
I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes,<br />
Had rather hear you praise<br />
This bosomful of songs</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Than that the whole, hard world with one consent,<br />
In one continuous chorus of applause<br />
Poured forth for me and mine<br />
The homage of ripe praise.</p>
<p class="poetry">I write the finis here against my love,<br />
This is my love&rsquo;s last epitaph and tomb.<br />
Here the road forks, and I<br />
Go my way, far from yours.</p>
<h2>THE OLD CHIM&AElig;RAS, OLD RECEIPTS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> old
Chim&aelig;ras, old receipts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For making &ldquo;happy land,&rdquo;<br />
The old political beliefs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swam close before my hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">The grand old communistic myths<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a middle state of grace,<br />
Quite dead, but not yet gone to Hell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And walking for a space,</p>
<p class="poetry">Quite dead, and looking it, and yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All eagerness to show<br />
The Social-Contract forgeries<br />

<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>A hundred such as these I tried,<br />

I fitted Social Theories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As one would fit a hat!</p>
<p class="poetry">Full many a marsh-fire lured me on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached at many a star,<br />
I reached and grasped them and behold&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stump of a cigar!</p>
<p class="poetry">All through the sultry sweltering day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweat ran down my brow,<br />
The still plains heard my distant strokes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That have been silenced now.</p>
<p class="poetry">This way and that, now up, now down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hailed full many a blow.<br />
Alas! beneath my weary arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thicket seemed to grow.</p>
<p class="poetry">I take the lesson, wipe my brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw my axe aside,<br />
And, sorely wearied, I go home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the tranquil eventide.</p>
<p class="poetry">And soon the rising moon, that lights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eve of my defeat,<br />
Shall see me sitting as of yore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By my old master&rsquo;s feet.</p>

10</span>PRELUDE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">By</span> sunny
market-place and street<br />
Wherever I go my drum I beat,<br />
And wherever I go in my coat of red<br />
The ribbons flutter about my head.</p>
<p class="poetry">I seek recruits for wars to come&mdash;<br />
For slaughterless wars I beat the drum,<br />
And the shilling I give to each new ally<br />
Is hope to live and courage to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know that new recruits shall come<br />
Wherever I beat the sounding drum,<br />
Till the roar of the march by country and town<br />
Shall shake the tottering Dagons down.</p>
<p class="poetry">For I was objectless as they<br />
And loitering idly day by day;<br />
But whenever I heard the recruiters come,<br />
I left my all to follow the drum.</p>

The locket, pictureless?&nbsp; O heart of mine,<br />
Art thou not worse than that,<br />
Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat?</p>
<p class="poetry">Her image nestled closer at my heart<br />
Than cherished memories, healed every smart<br />
And warmed it more than wine<br />
Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine.</p>
<p class="poetry">This was the little weather gleam that lit<br

The cloudy promontories&mdash;the real charm was<br />
That gilded hills and woods<br />
And walked beside me thro&rsquo; the solitudes.</p>

now<br />
Of that companion-thought.&nbsp; Alone I plough<br />
The seas of life, and trace<br />
A separate furrow far from her and grace.</p>

A nearer knowledge of great thoughts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrills vaguely through my brain.</p>
<p class="poetry">I lean my head upon my arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart&rsquo;s too full to think;<br />

CHILDISH SLAVES OF SOCIAL RULES</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Hail</span>!&nbsp; Childish
slaves of social rules<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You had yourselves a hand in making!<br />
How I could shake your faith, ye fools,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If but I thought it worth the shaking.<br />
I see, and pity you; and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, casting off the idle pity,<br />
In search of better, braver men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My own way freely through the city.</p>
<p class="poetry">My own way freely, and not yours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, careless of a town&rsquo;s abusing,<br />
Seek real friendship that endures<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the friends of my own choosing.<br />
I&rsquo;ll choose my friends myself, do you hear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And won&rsquo;t let Mrs. Grundy do it,<br />
Tho&rsquo; all I honour and hold dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all I hope should move me to it.</p>
<p class="poetry">I take my old coat from the shelf&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a man of little breeding.<br />
And only dress to please myself&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I own, a very strange proceeding.<br />
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>I smoke a
pipe abroad, because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To all cigars I much prefer it,<br />
And as I scorn your social laws<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My choice has nothing to deter it.</p>
<p class="poetry">Gladly I trudge the footpath way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While you and yours roll by in coaches<br />
In all the pride of fine array,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all the city&rsquo;s thronged approaches.<br
/>
O fine religious, decent folk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Virtue&rsquo;s flaunting gold and scarlet,<br />
I sneer between two puffs of smoke,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the publican and harlot.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye dainty-spoken, stiff, severe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seed of the migrated Philistian,<br />
One whispered question in your ear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray, what was Christ, if you be Christian?<br />
If Christ were only here just now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the city&rsquo;s wynds and gables<br />
Teaching the life he taught us, how<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would he be welcome to your tables?</p>
<p class="poetry">I go and leave your logic-straws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your former-friends with face averted,<br />
Your petty ways and narrow laws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Grundy and your God, deserted.<br />
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>From your
frail ark of lies, I flee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not where, like Noah&rsquo;s raven.<br />
Full to the broad, unsounded sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I swim from your dishonest haven.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alone on that unsounded deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor waif, it may be I shall perish,<br />
Far from the course I thought to keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from the friends I hoped to cherish.<br />
It may be that I shall sink, and yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear, thro&rsquo; all taunt and scornful
laughter,<br />
Through all defeat and all regret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stronger swimmers coming after.</p>
<h2>SWALLOWS TRAVEL TO AND FRO</h2>

Breezes hasten, swallows fly,<br />
Towered clouds forever ply,<br />
And at noonday, you and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See the same sunshine above.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dew and rain fall everywhere,<br />
Harvests ripen, flowers are fair,<br />

live air, fanned with wings,<br />
Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings<br />
Into contact distant things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes all the countries one.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let us wander where we will,<br />
Something kindred greets us still;<br />
Something seen on vale or hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Falls familiar on the heart;<br />
So, at scent or sound or sight,<br />
Severed souls by day and night<br />
Tremble with the same delight&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tremble, half the world apart.</p>

To meet all fortunes nobly, to endure<br />
All things with a good heart, and still be pure,<br />
Still to be foremost in the foremost cause,<br />
And still be worthy of the love that was.<br />

<h2>I DO NOT FEAR TO OWN ME KIN</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">do</span> not fear to own

To the glad clods in which spring flowers begin;<br />
Or to my brothers, the great trees,<br />
That speak with pleasant voices in the breeze,<br />
Loud talkers with the winds that pass;<br />
Or to my sister, the deep grass.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of such I am, of such my body is,<br />
That thrills to reach its lips to kiss.<br />
That gives and takes with wind and sun and rain<br />
And feels keen pleasure to the point of pain.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

The brotherhood of stalwart trees,<br />
The humble family of flowers,<br />
That make a light of shadowy bowers<br />
Or star the edges of the bent:<br />
They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent;<br />
They joy to shed themselves abroad;<br />
And tree and flower and grass and sod<br />
Thrill and leap and live and sing<br />
With silent voices in the Spring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hence I not fear to yield my breath,<br />
Since all is still unchanged by death;<br />
Since in some pleasant valley I may be,<br />
Clod beside clod, or tree by tree,<br />
Long ages hence, with her I love this hour;<br />
And feel a lively joy to share<br />
With her the sun and rain and air,<br />
To taste her quiet neighbourhood<br />
As the dumb things of field and wood,<br />
The clod, the tree, and starry flower,<br />
Alone of all things have the power.</p>

<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">am</span> like one that
for long days had sate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With seaward eyes set keen against the gale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On some lone foreland, watching sail by sail,<br />
The portbound ships for one ship that was late;<br />
And sail by sail, his heart burned up with joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cruelly was quenched, until at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One ship, the looked-for pennant at its mast,<br />
Bore gaily, and dropt safely past the buoy;<br />
And lo! the loved one was not there&mdash;was dead.<br />
Then would he watch no more; no more the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With myriad vessels, sail by sail, perplex<br />
His eyes and mock his longing.&nbsp; Weary head,<br />
Take now thy rest; eyes, close; for no more me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall hopes untried elate, or ruined vex.</p>
<p class="poetry">For thus on love I waited; thus for love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strained all my senses eagerly and long;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus for her coming ever trimmed my song;<br />
Till in the far skies coloured as a dove,<br />
A bird gold-coloured flickered far and fled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the pathless waterwaste for me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with spread hands I watched the bright bird
flee<br />
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>And
waited, till before me she dropped dead.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O golden bird in these dove-coloured skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How long I sought, how long with wearied eyes<br />
I sought, O bird, the promise of thy flight!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now the morn has dawned, the morn has died,<br

The day has come and gone; and once more night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About my lone life settles, wild and wide.</p>

<h2>FLOWER GOD, GOD OF THE SPRING</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Flower</span> god, god of
the spring, beautiful, bountiful,<br />
Cold-dyed shield in the sky, lover of versicles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I wander in April<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold, grey-headed; and still to my<br />
Heart, Spring comes with a bound, Spring the deliverer,<br />
Spring, song-leader in woods, chorally resonant;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring, flower-planter in meadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Child-conductor in willowy<br />
Fields deep dotted with bloom, daisies and crocuses:<br />
Here that child from his heart drinks of eternity:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O child, happy are children!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She still smiles on their innocence,<br />
She, dear mother in God, fostering violets,<br />
Fills earth full of her scents, voices and violins:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakes old chords in the memory:<br />
Thus fair earth in the Spring leads her performances.<br />
One more touch of the bow, smell of the virginal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Green&mdash;one more, and my bosom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Feels new life with an ecstasy.</p>
<h2>COME, MY BELOVED, HEAR FROM ME</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span>, my beloved,
hear from me<br />
Tales of the woods or open sea.<br />
Let our aspiring fancy rise<br />
A wren&rsquo;s flight higher toward the skies;<br />
Or far from cities, brown and bare,<br />
Play at the least in open air.<br />
In all the tales men hear us tell<br />
Still let the unfathomed ocean swell,<br />
Or shallower forest sound abroad<br />
Below the lonely stars of God;<br />
In all, let something still be done,<br />
Still in a corner shine the sun,<br />
Slim-ankled maids be fleet of foot,<br />
Nor man disown the rural flute.<br />
Still let the hero from the start<br />
In honest sweat and beats of heart<br />
Push on along the untrodden road<br />
For some inviolate abode.<br />
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Still, O
beloved, let me hear<br />
The great bell beating far and near&mdash;<br />
The odd, unknown, enchanted gong<br />
That on the road hales men along,<br />
That from the mountain calls afar,<br />
That lures a vessel from a star,<br />
And with a still, aerial sound<br />
Makes all the earth enchanted ground.<br />
Love, and the love of life and act<br />
Dance, live and sing through all our furrowed tract;<br />
Till the great God enamoured gives<br />
To him who reads, to him who lives,<br />
That rare and fair romantic strain<br />
That whoso hears must hear again.</p>
<h2>SINCE YEARS AGO FOR EVERMORE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Since</span> years ago for
evermore<br />
My cedar ship I drew to shore;<br />
And to the road and riverbed<br />
And the green, nodding reeds, I said<br />
Mine ignorant and last farewell:<br />
Now with content at home I dwell,<br />
And now divide my sluggish life<br />
Betwixt my verses and my wife:<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>In vain;
for when the lamp is lit<br />
And by the laughing fire I sit,<br />
Still with the tattered atlas spread<br />
Interminable roads I tread.</p>
<h2>ENVOY FOR &ldquo;A CHILD&rsquo;S GARDEN OF VERSES&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Whether</span> upon the
garden seat<br />
You lounge with your uplifted feet<br />
Under the May&rsquo;s whole Heaven of blue;<br />
Or whether on the sofa you,<br />
No grown up person being by,<br />
Do some soft corner occupy;<br />
Take you this volume in your hands<br />
And enter into other lands,<br />
For lo! (as children feign) suppose<br />
You, hunting in the garden rows,<br />
Or in the lumbered attic, or<br />
The cellar&mdash;a nail-studded door<br />
And dark, descending stairway found<br />
That led to kingdoms underground:<br />
There standing, you should hear with ease<br />
Strange birds a-singing, or the trees<br />
Swing in big robber woods, or bells<br />
On many fairy citadels:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>There passing through (a step or so&mdash;<br />
Neither mamma nor nurse need know!)<br />
From your nice nurseries you would pass,<br />
Like Alice through the Looking-Glass<br />
Or Gerda following Little Ray,<br />
To wondrous countries far away.<br />
Well, and just so this volume can<br />
Transport each little maid or man<br />
Presto from where they live away<br />
Where other children used to play.<br />
As from the house your mother sees<br />
You playing round the garden trees,<br />
So you may see if you but look<br />
Through the windows of this book<br />
Another child far, far away<br />
And in another garden play.<br />
But do not think you can at all,<br />
By knocking on the window, call<br />
That child to hear you.&nbsp; He intent<br />
Is still on his play-business bent.<br />
He does not hear, he will not look,<br />
Nor yet be lured out of this book.<br />
For long ago, the truth to say,<br />
He has grown up and gone away;<br />
And it is but a child of air<br />
That lingers in the garden there.</p>

Why should I sail, why should the breeze?<br />
I have been young, and I have counted friends.<br />
A hopeless sail I spread, too late, too late.<br />
Why should I from isle to isle<br />
Sail, a hopeless sailor?</p>

Home with you, home and lay your little head at rest,<br />

Lullaby, darling; your mother is watching you; she&rsquo;ll be

We also, love, forever dwell apart;<br />
With cries approach, with cries behold the gulph,<br />
The Unvaulted; as two great eagles that do wheel in air<br />
Above a mountain, and with screams confer,<br />
Far heard athwart the cedars.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet the years<br />

Endearing, week by week, till death at last<br />
Dissolve that long divorce.&nbsp; By faith we love,<br />
Not knowledge; and by faith, though far removed,<br />
Dwell as in perfect nearness, heart to heart.<br />

Alone the primal bower we weave;<br />
Sequestered in the seas of life,<br />

Revisit all our tillage land,<br />
And marvel at our strange estate,<br />
For hooded ruin at the gate<br />
Sits watchful, and the angels fear<br />
To see us tread so boldly here.<br />
Meanwhile, my Eve, with flower and grass<br />
Our perishable days we pass;<br />
Far more the thorn observe&mdash;and see<br />
How our enormous sins go free&mdash;<br />

A disused quarry, paved with rose plots, hung<br />
With clematis, the barren womb whence sprung<br />
The crow-stepped house itself, that now far seen<br />
Stands, like a bather, to the neck in green.<br />
A disused quarry, furnished with a seat<br />
Sacred to pipes and meditation meet<br />

Halfway to the zenith all the vacant sky<br />

How she delighted men-folk long ago.<br />

Hot was the day; her weary sire and I<br />
Sat in our chairs companionably nigh,<br />

Divined the giants&rsquo; languor by their mien,<br />

Tackled at once an Atlantean chair.<br />
Her pigmy stature scarce attained the seat&mdash;<br />
She dragged it where she would, and with her feet<br />
Surmounted; thence, a Phaeton launched, she crowned<br />
The vast plateau of the piano, found<br />
And culled a pair of fans; wherewith equipped,<br />
Our mountaineer back to the level slipped;<br />
And being landed, with considerate eyes,<br />
Betwixt her elders dealt her double prize;<br />
The small to me, the greater to her sire.<br />

Spied her mistake, nor sooner spied than ran<br />
To remedy; and with the greater fan,<br />
In gracious better thought, equipped the guest.</p>
<p class="poetry">From ill to well, from better on to best,<br />
Arts move; the homely, like the plastic kind;<br />
And high ideals fired that infant mind.<br />
Once more she backed, once more a space apart<br />
Considered and reviewed her work of art:<br />
Doubtful at first, and gravely yet awhile;<br />
Till all her features blossomed in a smile.<br />
And the child, waking at the call of bliss,<br />
To each she ran, and took and gave a kiss.</p>

And (O strange chance, more sorrowful than sweet)<br />
The counterfeit of her that was my fate,<br />
Dressed in like vesture, graceful and sedate,<br />
Went quietly up the vacant village street,<br />
The still small sound of her most dainty feet<br />
Shook, like a trumpet blast, my soul&rsquo;s estate.<br />
Instant revolt ran riot through my brain,<br />
And all night long, thereafter, hour by hour,<br />
The pageant of dead love before my eyes<br />
Went proudly; and old hopes, broke loose again<br />
From the restraint of wisely temperate power,<br />
With ineffectual ardour sought to rise.</p>
<h3><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>VII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The strong man&rsquo;s hand, the snow-cool head
of age,<br />
The certain-footed sympathies of youth&mdash;<br />
These, and that lofty passion after truth,<br />
Hunger unsatisfied in priest or sage<br />
Or the great men of former years, he needs<br />
That not unworthily would dare to sing<br />
(Hard task!) black care&rsquo;s inevitable ring<br />
Settling with years upon the heart that feeds<br />
Incessantly on glory.&nbsp; Year by year<br />
The narrowing toil grows closer round his feet;<br />
With disenchanting touch rude-handed time<br />
The unlovely web discloses, and strange fear<br />
Leads him at last to eld&rsquo;s inclement seat,<br />
The bitter north of life&mdash;a frozen clime.</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">As Daniel, bird-alone, in that far land,<br />
Kneeling in fervent prayer, with heart-sick eyes<br />
Turned thro&rsquo; the casement toward the westering skies;<br />
Or as untamed Elijah, that red brand<br />
Among the starry prophets; or that band<br />
And company of Faithful sanctities<br />
Who in all times, when persecutions rise,<br />
Cherish forgotten creeds with fostering hand:<br />
Such do ye seem to me, light-hearted crew,<br />
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>O turned
to friendly arts with all your will,<br />
That keep a little chapel sacred still,<br />
One rood of Holy-land in this bleak earth<br />
Sequestered still (our homage surely due!)<br />
To the twin Gods of mirthful wine and mirth.</p>
<p class="poetry">About my fields, in the broad sun<br />
And blaze of noon, there goeth one,<br />
Barefoot and robed in blue, to scan<br />
With the hard eye of the husbandman<br />
My harvests and my cattle.&nbsp; Her,<br />
When even puts the birds astir<br />
And day has set in the great woods,<br />
We seek, among her garden roods,<br />
With bells and cries in vain: the while<br />
Lamps, plate, and the decanter smile<br />
On the forgotten board.&nbsp; But she,<br />
Deaf, blind, and prone on face and knee,<br />
Forgets time, family, and feast,<br />
And digs like a demented beast.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tall as a guardsman, pale as the east at
dawn,<br />
Who strides in strange apparel on the lawn?<br />
Rails for his breakfast? routs his vassals out<br />
(Like boys escaped from school) with song and shout?<br />
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Kind and
unkind, his Maker&rsquo;s final freak,<br />
Part we deride the child, part dread the antique!<br />
See where his gang, like frogs, among the dew<br />
Crouch at their duty, an unquiet crew;<br />
Adjust their staring kilts; and their swift eyes<br />
Turn still to him who sits to supervise.<br />
He in the midst, perched on a fallen tree,<br />
Eyes them at labour; and, guitar on knee,<br />
Now ministers alarm, now scatters joy,<br />
Now twangs a halting chord, now tweaks a boy.<br />
Thorough in all, my resolute vizier<br />
Plays both the despot and the volunteer,<br />
Exacts with fines obedience to my laws,<br />
And for his music, too, exacts applause.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Adorner of the uncomely&mdash;those<br />
Amidst whose tall battalions goes<br />
Her pretty person out and in<br />
All day with an endearing din,<br />
Of censure and encouragement;<br />
And when all else is tried in vain<br />
See her sit down and weep again.<br />
She weeps to conquer;<br />
She varies on her grenadiers<br />
From satire up to girlish tears!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Or rather to behold her when<br />
She plies for me the unresting pen,<br />
And when the loud assault of squalls<br />
Resounds upon the roof and walls,<br />
And the low thunder growls and I<br />
Raise my dictating voice on high.</p>
<p class="poetry">What glory for a boy of ten<br />
Who now must three gigantic men<br />
And two enormous, dapple grey<br />
New Zealand pack-horses array<br />
And lead, and wisely resolute<br />
Our day-long business execute<br />
In the far shore-side town.&nbsp; His soul<br />
Glows in his bosom like a coal;<br />
His innocent eyes glitter again,<br />
And his hand trembles on the rein.<br />
Once he reviews his whole command,<br />
And chivalrously planting hand<br />
On hip&mdash;a borrowed attitude&mdash;<br />
Rides off downhill into the wood.</p>
<p class="poetry">I meanwhile in the populous house apart<br />
Sit snugly chambered, and my silent art<br />
Uninterrupted, unremitting ply<br />
Before the dawn, by morning lamplight, by<br />
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>The glow
of smelting noon, and when the sun<br />
Dips past my westering hill and day is done;<br />
So, bending still over my trade of words,<br />
I hear the morning and the evening birds,<br />
The morning and the evening stars behold;<br />
So there apart I sit as once of old<br />
Napier in wizard Merchiston; and my<br />
Brown innocent aides in home and husbandry<br />
Wonder askance.&nbsp; What ails the boss? they ask.<br />
Him, richest of the rich, an endless task<br />
Before the earliest birds or servants stir<br />
Calls and detains him daylong prisoner?<br />
He whose innumerable dollars hewed<br />
This cleft in the boar and devil-haunted wood,<br />
And bade therein, from sun to seas and skies,<br />
His many-windowed, painted palace rise<br />
Red-roofed, blue-walled, a rainbow on the hill,<br />
A wonder in the forest glade: he still,</p>
<p class="poetry">Unthinkable Aladdin, dawn and dark,<br />
Scribbles and scribbles, like a German clerk.<br />
We see the fact, but tell, O tell us why?<br />
My reverend washman and wise butler cry.<br />
Meanwhile at times the manifold<br />
Imperishable perfumes of the past<br />
And coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast:<br />
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>And I
remember the white rime, the loud<br />
Lamplitten city, shops, and the changing crowd;<br />
And I remember home and the old time,<br />
The winding river, the white moving rhyme,<br />
The autumn robin by the river-side<br />
That pipes in the grey eve.</p>
<p class="poetry">The old lady (so they say), but I<br />
Admire your young vitality.<br />
Still brisk of foot, still busy and keen<br />
In and about and up and down.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hear you pass with bustling feet<br />
The long verandahs round, and beat<br />
Your bell, and &ldquo;Lotu!&nbsp; Lotu!&rdquo; cry;<br />
Thus calling our queer company,<br />
In morning or in evening dim,<br />
To prayers and the oft mangled hymn.</p>
<p class="poetry">All day you watch across the sky<br />
The silent, shining cloudlands ply,<br />
That, huge as countries, swift as birds,<br />
Beshade the isles by halves and thirds,<br />
Till each with battlemented crest<br />
Stands anchored in the ensanguined west,<br />
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>An Alp
enchanted.&nbsp; All the day<br />
You hear the exuberant wind at play,<br />
In vast, unbroken voice uplift,<br />
In roaring tree, round whistling clift.</p>
<h2>AIR OF DIABELLI&rsquo;S</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Call</span> it to mind, O
my love.<br />
Dear were your eyes as the day,<br />
Bright as the day and the sky;<br />
Like the stream of gold and the sky above,<br />
Dear were your eyes in the grey.<br />
We have lived, my love, O, we have lived, my love!<br />
Now along the silent river, azure<br />
Through the sky&rsquo;s inverted image,<br />
Softly swam the boat that bore our love,<br />
Swiftly ran the shallow of our love<br />
Through the heaven&rsquo;s inverted image,<br />
In the reedy mazes round the river.<br />
See along the silent river,</p>
<p class="poetry">See of old the lover&rsquo;s shallop steer.<br
/>
Berried brake and reedy island,<br />
Heaven below and only heaven above.<br />
Through the sky&rsquo;s inverted image<br />
Swiftly swam the boat that bore our love.<br />
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Berried
brake and reedy island,<br />
Mirrored flower and shallop gliding by.<br />
All the earth and all the sky were ours,<br />
Silent sat the wafted lovers,<br />
Bound with grain and watched by all the sky,<br />
Hand to hand and eye to . . . eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">Days of April, airs of Eden,<br />
Call to mind how bright the vanished angel hours,<br />
Golden hours of evening,<br />
When our boat drew homeward filled with flowers.<br />
O darling, call them to mind; love the past, my love.<br />
Days of April, airs of Eden.<br />
How the glory died through golden hours,<br />
And the shining moon arising;<br />
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers.<br />
Age and winter close us slowly in.</p>
<p class="poetry">Level river, cloudless heaven,<br />
Islanded reed mazes, silver weirs;<br />
How the silent boat with silver<br />
Threads the inverted forest as she goes,<br />
Broke the trembling green of mirrored trees.<br />
O, remember, and remember<br />
How the berries hung in garlands.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still in the river see the shallop floats.<br
/>
Hark!&nbsp; Chimes the falling oar.<br />
<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Still in
the mind<br />
Hark to the song of the past!<br />
Dream, and they pass in their dreams.</p>
<p class="poetry">Those that loved of yore, O those that loved of
yore!<br />
Hark through the stillness, O darling, hark!<br />
Through it all the ear of the mind</p>
<p class="poetry">Knows the boat of love.&nbsp; Hark!<br />
Chimes the falling oar.</p>
<p class="poetry">O half in vain they grew old.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the halcyon days are over,<br />
Age and winter close us slowly round,<br />
And these sounds at fall of even<br />
Dim the sight and muffle all the sound.<br />
And at the married fireside, sleep of soul and sleep of fancy,<br
/>
Joan and Darby.<br />
Silence of the world without a sound;<br />
And beside the winter faggot</p>
<p class="poetry">Joan and Darby sit and dose and dream and
wake&mdash;<br />
Dream they hear the flowing, singing river,<br />
See the berries in the island brake;<br />
Dream they hear the weir,<br />
See the gliding shallop mar the stream.<br />
Hark! in your dreams do you hear?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Snow has filled the drifted forest;<br />
Ice has bound the . . . stream.<br />
Frost has bound our flowing river;<br />
Snow has whitened all our island brake.</p>
<p class="poetry">Berried brake and reedy island,<br />
Heaven below and only heaven above azure<br />
Through the sky&rsquo;s inverted image<br />
Safely swam the boat that bore our love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear were your eyes as the day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright ran the stream, bright hung the sky above.<br
/>
Days of April, airs of Eden.<br />
How the glory died through golden hours,<br />
And the shining moon arising,<br />
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright were your eyes in the night:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have lived, my love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O, we have loved, my love.<br />
Now the . . . days are over,<br />
Age and winter close us slowly round.</p>
<p class="poetry">Vainly time departs, and vainly<br />
Age and winter come and close us round.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hark the river&rsquo;s long continuous
sound.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hear the river ripples in the reeds.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo, in dreams they see their shallop<br />
Run the lilies down and drown the weeds<br />
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Mid the
sound of crackling faggots.<br />
So in dreams the new created<br />
Happy past returns, to-day recedes,<br />
And they hear once more,</p>
<p class="poetry">From the old years,<br />
Yesterday returns, to-day recedes,<br />
And they hear with aged hearing warbles</p>
<p class="poetry">Love&rsquo;s own river ripple in the weeds.<br
/>
And again the lover&rsquo;s shallop;<br />
Lo, the shallop sheds the streaming weeds;<br />
And afar in foreign countries<br />
In the ears of aged lovers.</p>
<p class="poetry">And again in winter evens<br />
Starred with lilies . . . with stirring weeds.<br />
In these ears of aged lovers<br />
Love&rsquo;s own river ripples in the reeds.</p>
<h2>EPITAPHIUM EROTII</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Here</span> lies Erotion,
whom at six years old<br />
Fate pilfered.&nbsp; Stranger (when I too am cold,<br />
Who shall succeed me in my rural field),<br />
To this small spirit annual honours yield!<br />
Bright be thy hearth, hale be thy babes, I crave<br />
And this, in thy green farm, the only grave.</p>
<h2><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>DE
M. ANTONIO</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> Antoninus, in a
smiling age,<br />
Counts of his life the fifteenth finished stage.<br />
The rounded days and the safe years he sees,<br />
Nor fears death&rsquo;s water mounting round his knees.<br />
To him remembering not one day is sad,<br />
Not one but that its memory makes him glad.<br />
So good men lengthen life; and to recall<br />
The past is to have twice enjoyed it all.</p>
<h2>AD MAGISTRUM LUDI</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span class="smcap">Unfinished
Draft</span>.)</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> in the sky<br />
And on the hearth of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in a drawer the direful cane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sceptre of the . . . reign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the long hawser, that on the back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Marsyas fell with many a whack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice hardened out of Scythian hides,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now sleep till the October ides.</p>
<p class="poetry">In summer if the boys be well.</p>
<h2><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>AD
NEPOTEM</h2>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">Nepos</span>, twice my
neigh(b)our (since at home<br />
We&rsquo;re door by door, by Flora&rsquo;s temple dome;<br />
And in the country, still conjoined by fate,<br />
Behold our villas standing gate by gate),<br />
Thou hast a daughter, dearer far than life&mdash;<br />
Thy image and the image of thy wife.<br />
Thy image and thy wife&rsquo;s, and be it so!</p>
<p class="poetry">But why for her, [ neglect the flowing / O
Nepos, leave the ] can</p>
<p class="poetry">And lose the prime of thy Falernian?<br />
Hoard casks of money, if to hoard be thine;<br />
But let thy daughter drink a younger wine!<br />
Let her go rich and wise, in silk and fur;</p>
<p class="poetry">Lay down a [ bin that shall / vintage to ] grow
old with her;</p>
<p class="poetry">But thou, meantime, the while the batch is
sound,<br />
With pleased companions pass the bowl around;<br />
Nor let the childless only taste delights,<br />
For Fathers also may enjoy their nights.</p>
<h2><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>IN
CHARIDEMUM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span>, Charidemus, who
my cradle swung,<br />
And watched me all the days that I was young;<br />
You, at whose step the laziest slaves awake,<br />
And both the bailiff and the butler quake;<br />
The barber&rsquo;s suds now blacken with my beard,<br />
And my rough kisses make the maids afeared;<br />
But with reproach your awful eyebrows twitch,<br />
And for the cane, I see, your fingers itch.<br />
If something daintily attired I go,<br />
Straight you exclaim: &ldquo;Your father did not so.&rdquo;<br />
And fuming, count the bottles on the board<br />
As though my cellar were your private hoard.<br />
Enough, at last: I have done all I can,<br />
And your own mistress hails me for a man.</p>
<h2>DE LIGURRA</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> fear,
Ligurra&mdash;above all, you long&mdash;<br />
That I should smite you with a stinging song.<br />
This dreadful honour you both fear and hope&mdash;<br />
Both all in vain: you fall below my scope.<br />
The Lybian lion tears the roaring bull,<br />
He does not harm the midge along the pool.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>Lo! if so close this stands in your regard,<br />
From some blind tap fish forth a drunken barn,<br />
Who shall with charcoal, on the privy wall,<br />
Immortalise your name for once and all.</p>
<h2>IN LUPUM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> the gates
thou gav&rsquo;st a field to till;<br />
I have a larger on my window-sill.<br />
A farm, d&rsquo;ye say?&nbsp; Is this a farm to you,<br />
Where for all woods I spay one tuft of rue,<br />
And that so rusty, and so small a thing,<br />
One shrill cicada hides it with a wing;<br />
Where one cucumber covers all the plain;<br />
And where one serpent rings himself in vain<br />
To enter wholly; and a single snail<br />
Eats all and exit fasting to the pool?<br />
Here shall my gardener be the dusty mole.<br />
My only ploughman the . . . mole.<br />
Here shall I wait in vain till figs be set,<br />
And till the spring disclose the violet.<br />
Through all my wilds a tameless mouse careers,<br />
And in that narrow boundary appears,<br />
Huge as the stalking lion of Algiers,<br />
Huge as the fabled boar of Calydon.<br />
And all my hay is at one swoop impresst<br />
By one low-flying swallow for her nest,<br />
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Strip
god Priapus of each attribute<br />
Here finds he scarce a pedestal to foot.<br />
The gathered harvest scarcely brims a spoon;<br />
And all my vintage drips in a cocoon.<br />
Generous are you, but I more generous still:<br />
Take back your farm and stand me half a gill!</p>
<h2>AD QUINTILIANUM</h2>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">chief</span> director of
the growing race,<br />
Of Rome the glory and of Rome the grace,<br />
Me, O Quintilian, may you not forgive<br />
Before from labour I make haste to live?<br />
Some burn to gather wealth, lay hands on rule,<br />
Or with white statues fill the atrium full.<br />
The talking hearth, the rafters sweet with smoke,<br />
Live fountains and rough grass, my line invoke:<br />
A sturdy slave, not too learned wife,<br />
Nights filled with slumber, and a quiet life.</p>
<h2>DE HORTIS JULII MARTIALIS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> Martial owns a
garden, famed to please,<br />
Beyond the glades of the Hesperides;<br />
Along Janiculum lies the chosen block<br />
Where the cool grottos trench the hanging rock.<br />
The moderate summit, something plain and bare,<br />
Tastes overhead of a serener air;<br />
<a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>And
while the clouds besiege the vales below,<br />
Keeps the clear heaven and doth with sunshine glow.<br />
To the June stars that circle in the skies<br />
The dainty roofs of that tall villa rise.<br />
Hence do the seven imperial hills appear;<br />
And you may view the whole of Rome from here;<br />
Beyond, the Alban and the Tuscan hills;<br />
And the cool groves and the cool falling rills,<br />
Rubre Fiden&aelig;, and with virgin blood<br />
Anointed once Perenna&rsquo;s orchard wood.<br />
Thence the Flaminian, the Salarian way,<br />
Stretch far broad below the dome of day;<br />
And lo! the traveller toiling towards his home;<br />
And all unheard, the chariot speeds to Rome!<br />
For here no whisper of the wheels; and tho&rsquo;<br />
The Mulvian Bridge, above the Tiber&rsquo;s flow,<br />
Hangs all in sight, and down the sacred stream<br />
The sliding barges vanish like a dream,<br />
The seaman&rsquo;s shrilling pipe not enters here,<br />
Nor the rude cries of porters on the pier.<br />
And if so rare the house, how rarer far<br />
The welcome and the weal that therein are!<br />
So free the access, the doors so widely thrown,<br />
You half imagine all to be your own.</p>
<h2><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>AD
MARTIALEM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Go</span>(<span
class="smcap">d</span>) knows, my Martial, if we two could be<br
/>
To enjoy our days set wholly free;<br />
To the true life together bend our mind,<br />
And take a furlough from the falser kind.<br />
No rich saloon, nor palace of the great,<br />
Nor suit at law should trouble our estate;<br />
On no vainglorious statues should we look,<br />
But of a walk, a talk, a little book,<br />
Baths, wells and meads, and the veranda shade,<br />
Let all our travels and our toils be made.<br />
Now neither lives unto himself, alas!<br />
And the good suns we see, that flash and pass<br />
And perish; and the bell that knells them cries:<br />
&ldquo;Another gone: O when will ye arise?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>IN MAXIMUM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Wouldst</span> thou be
free?&nbsp; I think it not, indeed;<br />
But if thou wouldst, attend this simple rede:<br />
[When quite contented / Thou shall be free when] thou canst dine
at home<br />
And drink a small wine of the march of Rome;<br />
When thou canst see unmoved thy neighbour&rsquo;s plate,<br />
And wear my threadbare toga in the gate;<br />
<a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>When
thou hast learned to love a small abode,<br />
And not to choose a mistress <i>&agrave; la mode</i>:<br />
When thus contained and bridled thou shalt be,<br />
Then, Maximus, then first shalt thou be free.</p>
<h2>AD OLUM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Call</span> me not rebel,
though [ here at every word / in what I sing ]<br />
If I no longer hail thee [ King and Lord / Lord and King ]<br />
I have redeemed myself with all I had,<br />
And now possess my fortunes poor but glad.<br />
With all I had I have redeemed myself,<br />
And escaped at once from slavery and pelf.<br />
The unruly wishes must a ruler take,<br />
Our high desires do our low fortunes make:<br />
Those only who desire palatial things<br />
Do bear the fetters and the frowns of Kings;<br />
Set free thy slave; thou settest free thyself.</p>
<h2>DE C&OElig;NATIONE MIC&AElig;</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Look</span> round: You see
a little supper room;<br />
But from my window, lo! great C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s tomb!<br />
And the great dead themselves, with jovial breath<br />
Bid you be merry and remember death.</p>
<h2><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>DE
EROTIO PUELLA</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> girl was
sweeter than the song of swans,<br />
And daintier than the lamb upon the lawns<br />
Or Curine oyster.&nbsp; She, the flower of girls,<br />
Outshone the light of Erythr&aelig;an pearls;<br />
The teeth of India that with polish glow,<br />
The untouched lilies or the morning snow.<br />
Her tresses did gold-dust outshine<br />
And fair hair of women of the Rhine.<br />
Compared to her the peacock seemed not fair,<br />
The squirrel lively, or the phoenix rare;<br />
Her on whose pyre the smoke still hovering waits;<br />
Her whom the greedy and unequal fates<br />
On the sixth dawning of her natal day,<br />
My child-love and my playmate&mdash;snatcht away.</p>
<h2>AD PISCATOREM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">For</span> these are sacred
fishes all<br />
Who know that lord that is the lord of all;<br />
Come to the brim and nose the friendly hand<br />
That sways and can beshadow all the land.<br />
Nor only so, but have their names, and come<br />
When they are summoned by the Lord of Rome.<br />
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Here
once his line an impious Lybian threw;<br />
And as with tremulous reed his prey he drew,<br />
Straight, the light failed him.<br />
He groped, nor found the prey that he had ta&rsquo;en.<br />
Now as a warning to the fisher clan<br />
Beside the lake he sits, a beggarman.<br />
Thou, then, while still thine innocence is pure,<br />
Flee swiftly, nor presume to set thy lure;<br />
Respect these fishes, for their friends are great;<br />
And in the waters empty all thy bait.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
